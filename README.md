## Known issues

This is more an annoyance than an issue, but if you receive a popup that asks if you want to open the webpage, you can allow the domain to always open.

![Popup to open webpage](/resources/trusted%20domains.png)

To allow the domain, click `configure trusted domains` and then click `trust https://getboostrap.com`.

Then vscode will not ask if the page can be opened.
